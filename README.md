This was my sixth project with HTML and CSS and I'm happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things, so I tried to structure HTML better and used BEM methodology and used flex and grid in CSS and introduced CSS Nesting and pseudo element properties.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
